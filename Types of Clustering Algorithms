üîç Types of Clustering Algorithms  

Here‚Äôs a quick guide to the most common clustering types used in machine learning:  

### 1. Partitioning Clustering  
- What: Divides data into non-overlapping groups (clusters).  
- Examples:  
  - K-Means: Splits data into K clusters by minimizing variance.  
  - K-Medoids: Uses actual data points (medoids) as cluster centers (robust to outliers).  
- Best for: Simple, spherical-shaped clusters.  

### 2. Hierarchical Clustering  
- What: Creates a tree-like structure (dendrogram) of nested clusters.  
- Types:  
  - Agglomerative: Starts with individual points and merges closest pairs.  
  - Divisive: Starts with one cluster and splits recursively.  
- Best for: Data with inherent hierarchies (e.g., biological taxonomies).  

### 3. Density-Based Clustering  
- What: Groups points in high-density regions, ignoring noise.  
- Examples:  
  - DBSCAN: Labels dense regions as clusters, marks sparse areas as outliers.  
  - OPTICS: Similar to DBSCAN but handles varying densities better.  
- Best for: Arbitrary-shaped clusters and noisy data.  

### 4. Model-Based Clustering  
- What: Fits probabilistic models (e.g., Gaussian distributions) to the data.  
- Examples:  
  - Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): Assumes data is a mix of multiple Gaussian distributions.  
- Best for: Overlapping clusters and uncertainty in assignments.  

### 5. Distribution-Based Clustering  
- What: Focuses on statistical distributions within data.  
- Example:  
  - Expectation-Maximization (EM): Iteratively estimates model parameters.  
- Best for: Data following known statistical patterns.  

### 6. Grid-Based Clustering  
- What: Divides data space into a grid structure and clusters grid cells.  
- Examples:  
  - STING: Uses statistical info from grid cells.  
  - CLIQUE: Finds dense subspaces in high-dimensional data.  
- Best for: Large datasets with uniform density.  

### 7. Fuzzy Clustering  
- What: Allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with membership probabilities.  
- Example:  
  - Fuzzy C-Means: Assigns partial membership to clusters.  
- Best for: Scenarios with ambiguous boundaries (e.g., customer preferences).  

### üéØ Which One to Use?  
- K-Means: Quick, simple, and works for well-separated clusters.  
- DBSCAN: Ideal for noisy data or irregular shapes.  
- Hierarchical: Great for exploring hierarchical relationships.  
- Fuzzy/GMM: Choose when data points can belong to multiple groups.
